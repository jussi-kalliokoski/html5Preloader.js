html5Preloader
==============

With the growing use of HTML5 and it taking over the browser game scene, developers need an easy API to preload their resources on to the browser. html5-preloader aims to offer this, and in a compact, yet customizable way. html5-preloader supports almost all of the data types out there, from mp4 to xml, and with flexible fallback support.

Why Choose H5P?
---------------

* It's lightweight, easy to use and flexible.
* You won't have to worry about browser differencies on file loading, the library does it for you.
* No more errors because some load wasn't finished yet.

Features
--------

* Supports all the major resources: audio, image, video, document/xml
* Versatile input syntax, you can add files just with ``` addFiles('file1.abc', 'file2.abc', ...) ``` syntax or you can use ``` 'myIdentifier*:file1.abc' ``` to specify an identifier for the file (for fetching the file afterwards, if necessary) and you can combine these with the flexible alternate filepath syntax, ie. ``` 'myFile*:file1.abc||alternate1.abc||alternate2.abc' ``` to provide fallbacks where necessary.
* Supports all the major MODERN browsers: Chrome/Chromium 6+, IE9+, Opera 10.6+, FF 3.6+, Safari 5+ (if you're not designing a web application that would require one of these browsers, you won't trigger code that isn't supported by the unmentioned browsers anyway, so basically this library supports all browsers)
* Advanced error handling and support for custom error handling via a single .onerror(e) event.
* Easily detect when all files have been loaded with an event titled ``` .onfinish() ```
* Use loaded files via ``` .getFile(identifier) ``` function. You can fetch all loaded files by ommiting an identifier.
* Graphical feedback extensions are easy to build, downloads include one such extension that draws a basic rotating loader, on the specified 2D context of a canvas.
* Secure: Minimum conflict with other js libraries. Robust coding makes sure all data remains unaltered by third parties (provided you make your html5Preloader instance a private variable as well)

Examples

Initializing
------------

First, include the script to your page (you can download the latest stable version from the downloads). Next, you need to create an instance of the html5-preloader:

```javascript

var myLoader = new html5Preloader();

```

 *File adding*

Now you should probably add some files to load, that's pretty straightforward to do:

```javascript

// You can call the .addFiles() function

myLoader.addFiles('file1', 'mysound*:sound.ogg||sound.mp3'); // To shorten load times, you should always offer the .mp3 as a last alternative.

// Or you can always add the files on construct, like this:
myLoader = new html5Preloader('file1', 'mysound*:sound.ogg||sound.mp3');

```

Events
Maybe we want to pop up a window saying done, when the file loading is complete, I mean, why not? (Because it's annoying, but for the sake of this example)

```javascript

myLoader.onfinish = function(){alert('Done')};

```

Or maybe, we want to pop out an error message when such an error occurs! The following code pops up a window saying 'Error occured while loading ' and the identifier of the file at hand. We also tell the loader to move on to the next file by returning true.

```javascript

myLoader.onerror = function(e){alert('Error occured while loading '+this.loadingFile); return true; };

```
